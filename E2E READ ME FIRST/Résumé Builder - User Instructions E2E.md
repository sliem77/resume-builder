# Welcome to the Instructions for the Résumé Builder!
## Here is the explanation on how to use it!

Upon entering the website, the first option you have is to upload an existing résumé. The uploader accepts text, PDF, and Word files. The uploader accepts any type of extension for Word, either DOCX or DOC. Uploading the existing résumé basically automates the "fill in the blanks" part. After autofilling your information, you have to choose your Template type. Below the options for the Templates, you can see a preview of each one. After you choose your type, you can go to the bottom of the page and choose whether you want your résumé as a PDF or Word file and click submit.

If you don't have an existing résumé, you do the same as shown above, however you skip the autofill part and fill in the blanks with your information.
