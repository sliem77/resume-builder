## Instructions for Word to LaTeX Conversion
Templates are in Word (.docx) and LaTeX (.tex) form

### Step 1:
    Make sure that you are in the correct directory where the templates is located.
        You can change your directory by using the command 
        "cd *directory name*"

    Run the following command in Terminal (Mac) or Command
    Prompt (Windows):
        pandoc Template1.docx -o Template1.tex

    Change the code if you're using a different file, ex. Template1.docx gets replaced by Template2.docx (if you choose that one)

### Step 2:
    Format the LaTeX to fit the template by going to ChatGPT and type in the following:
        "*copy and paste the created .tex file code* 
        
        format this to:
        
        *template latex code*"
